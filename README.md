This project aims to provide Machine Learning tools to predict Wind Electricity in the island of Irelang for the next 24 h.
The goal will be to present predictions every day at 21:00, if and when (what Hours) will the ratio of Wind generated electricity reaches the currently supported maximum (70%): 
- Predict Wind Electricity hourly generation for the next 24h .
- Compare to predicted demand as per Eirgrid Smartgriddashboard.eirgrid.com 
- Highlighlight hours where Wind generations is higher than 70% demand: manually set up battery charging for those hours!

The following Colabs implement loading relevant data from Met.ie and smartgriddashboard.eirgrid.com , handle missing data and outliers, merge the data into 1 feature vector, try a few different Machine Learning with relevant feature engineering options, and forecast for the next day!
